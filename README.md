## RPO Dashboard - Ugat (Team 14)

## The Problem
AsiaDHRRA is driven to assist Rural People's Organizations all across South East Asia with developing communities that are just, free, prosperous, living in peace and working in solidarity towards their well-being. They hold a strong belief that data is the key factor in this mission, yet due to the lack of digitization at many RPOs, this key factor is very difficult to aggregate.
## About our Project (Proposed Solution)
This is a prototype for a platform solution, which we believe will assist AsiaDHRAA greatly in the digitization of the RPOs under their umbrella. Using data analytics as well as document processing techniques, our platform will not only help AsiaDHRAA with the aggregation of their data, but also with the making of informed decisions based on this data.
